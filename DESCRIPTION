Description: Graph_Sampler is a graph or network inference and simulation package developed in C by Frederic Bois. 
    Graph_Sampler allows fully Bayesian inference on Bayesian networks' structure via Markov chain Monte Carlo.
    This package is a simple R wrapper for C code, which allows you to use using graph_sampler in R, without need to 
    compile C code. It also provides convenience functions for working with outputs.
